OpenVZ creates multiple secure, isolated Linux containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict. Each container performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server; a container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users, IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries and configuration files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","Time":"2015-05-08T12:36:17Z","Tags":["Linux","bash","xterm-color"]}
